            <p>
                Redeemers is India's favourite hangout for coffee and conversation.Popularly known as RDM, we strive to provide the best experience to our guests. Our coffees are sourced from thousands of small coffee planters, who made us who we are today and we're glad to be a part of their lives. We opened our first cafe in 2009 at Brigade Road in Bangalore – the youth and the young at heart immediately took to the cafe, and it continues to be one of the most happening places in the city. RDM to the youth is a “hangout” spot where they meet people, make conversations, and have a lot of fun over steaming cups of great coffee, fizzly sweet juices, yummy maggie and delicious sandwiches and frankie.It's been an exciting journey since then to becoming the largest organised retail cafe chain in the country. We're also present in Chennai so do enjoy our food and drinks.
